Here's a quick guide on how to use the bot effectively:\n\n1. **Opening a Mail**: To open a new mail, simply send a message to the bot with your query or concern. The bot will create a new mail ticket for you.\n\n**For server ADMINS and WHITELISTED users:**\n2. **Viewing Mails**: Use the `/mails` command to view all your open mails. You can navigate through pages if you have multiple mails.\n\n3. **Responding to Mails**: To respond to a mail, use the `/respond` command followed by the mail ID and your message. This will send your response to the support team handling your mail.\n\n4. **Closing Mails**: Once your issue is resolved, you can close the mail using the `/close` command followed by the mail ID. This will mark the mail as closed.\n\n5. **Whitelist Management**: If you have permissions, you can manage the whitelist using the `/whitelist` command to add or remove users who can access certain features of the bot.\n\nIf you need further assistance, feel free to reach out to our support team!"
